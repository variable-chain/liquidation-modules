1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Obtain the input parameters, including the trader's position size, entry price, leverage, funding rate, and market price.

2. **Mark Price Calculation**:
   - Calculate the mark price, which is typically an index price derived from the underlying assets. It's used as a reference price for traders' positions.

3. **Funding Rate Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the mark price based on the funding rate. If it's positive, add it to the mark price; if negative, subtract it.

4. **Liquidation Price Calculation**:
   - Calculate the liquidation price, which is the price at which the trader's position will be liquidated to prevent further losses. It's often determined by the margin level and leverage.

5. **Fair Price Calculation**:
   - Calculate the fair price of the trader's position. This can be done using various models like the Black-Scholes model or more sophisticated methods like the Perpetual Swap Pricing Formula.

6. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the fair price to the current market price and liquidation price.
   - If the market price is above the liquidation price, the position is safe.
   - If the market price is close to or below the liquidation price, it's a potential liquidation event.
   - If the fair price significantly deviates from the market price, this may signal arbitrage opportunities.

7. **Liquidation Trigger**:
   - Implement logic to trigger liquidation when the market price breaches the liquidation price.

8. **Risk Management**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, you might implement mechanisms like partial liquidation or socialized losses to protect the exchange and traders.

9. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Continuously monitor market prices, funding rates, and positions to ensure the fair price remains accurate.

10. **Reporting and Alerts**:
    - Set up reporting and alerting systems to notify relevant parties (traders, administrators) of liquidation events or significant deviations in fair prices.

11. **Decision Point**:
    - At this stage, you might need to make decisions on specific liquidation events or adjustments to the fair price calculation. Your expertise as a senior developer will be valuable here.

12. **Logging and Documentation**:
    - Maintain comprehensive logs of all calculations and actions taken. Documentation is crucial for auditing and debugging.
